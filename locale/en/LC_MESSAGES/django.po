"Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, Jerusalem. During our studies,        we "

"improvements and optimization.</p>    <p>From an early stage we noticed that "
"people find our \"Dynamic Public    Transportation\" concept intriguing and "
"fascinating as it encourages them to think and dream.This is how the "
"circle    expanded and in the last two years many great partners, employees, "
"investors and advisors joined and formed    WAYbetter.</p>     <p>Now, we "
